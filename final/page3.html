                <h1>The Firthview Meadows Trail</h1>

                <p>
                    Starting at the farm’s main entrance, the Firthview Meadows Trail is a gentle, circular path that takes you through lush meadows filled with wildflowers. The trail is perfect for a relaxed walk, suitable for families and dog walkers. The route leads past grazing sheep and cattle, and offers panoramic views of the rolling hills and the shimmering waters of the Firth of Forth in the distance. Along the way, there are several benches where visitors can pause to take in the view or enjoy a picnic in the open fields.

                <h1>The Oakwood Forest Path</h1>

                <p>For those seeking a more immersive woodland experience, the Oakwood Forest Path is a must-do. This shaded trail winds through ancient oak trees, some of which are believed to be over 200 years old. The trail is lined with moss-covered stones, and the air is filled with the rich scent of pine and earth. The forest comes alive with birdsong, and if you’re lucky, you might spot deer grazing quietly among the trees. The path eventually leads to a secluded viewpoint overlooking a sparkling stream, ideal for a moment of reflection.</p>

                    Adjacent to the farm is Firthview Park, a large public park where families and locals gather for leisurely walks or outdoor activities. The park features a large pond, ideal for a peaceful afternoon of birdwatching or enjoying the quiet hum of nature. The park also has play areas for children, picnic spots, and sports fields for those wanting to enjoy a bit of tennis or football. During the summer months, the park hosts a weekly farmer's market, where visitors can sample fresh produce grown on the farm and buy handmade goods from local artisans.
