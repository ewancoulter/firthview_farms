                    <li><strong>Fainting goats:</strong> A unique and hilarious breed, these goats ‘faint’ when startled, collapsing briefly before jumping up again. They’re a crowd favorite!</li>

                <p>
                    The petting zoo is not just about interacting with the animals—it's also an educational experience. Each animal is part of the larger ecosystem, and we encourage visitors to learn more about how they live, what they eat, and how they’re cared for. It's a perfect opportunity for children to develop a love for animals and nature, while families make lasting memories together.
